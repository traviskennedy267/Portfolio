The encryption function provided is designed to enhance the security of a given secret by applying a simple and customizable encryption technique. By leveraging a user-specified shift value (obtained from an HTML form), the function transforms each character of the secret using a mathematical algorithm. This process alters the original characters' positions in a predefined set, effectively obfuscating the information.

The encryption function ensures that only characters within the specified set (which includes both alphabets and special characters) are transformed, maintaining the confidentiality of the secret. The shift value acts as a key, allowing users to customize the encryption strength. This added layer of security makes it more challenging for unauthorized individuals to decipher the original content, contributing to the protection of sensitive information.
